However, many birth injuries are caused because of mistakes made by medical professionals involved in the delivery. An experienced malpractice attorney should be consulted if you suspect that birth injuries were caused by medical mistake.', 'Nursing Home Injuries It is then beyond appalling when you discover that your family member has suffered neglect or abuse at the hands of the nursing home staff. These offenses can range from outright physical abuse, to the patient simply not getting the care to which they are entitled. A qualified lawyer can help you assess your case and provide best options for moving forward in your lawsuit.', 'Brain Injuries The leading causes of traumatic brain injuries are serious personal injury accidents such as car accidents, truck accidents, and highway accidents. However, serious brain injuries can also result from medical malpractice, slip-and-fall injuries, and construction accidents; including falls from scaffolding and electrocution.', 'Hospital Malpractice The investigation process is one of the most important steps involved in establishing a case for hospital negligence. Our highly skilled team has the resources, technology and tools available to determine the tests that should have been ordered and how the proper diagnosis should have been determined.', 'Surgical Errors In the event of a personal injury due to surgical error, nothing can fully restore you to your position prior to your accident. However, a Chicago personal attorney will ensure that you receive maximum compensation for your loss. An attorney will also ensure that you receive the financial resources you will need, now and in the future.', 'Bile Duct Injuries If a surgeon severs a bile duct during surgery, a patient can experience excruciating pain and other various medical conditions. A patient will likely be forced to undergo numerous future surgical operations to repair the severed bile duct and drain the bile as a result of a surgeon’s negligence. Gallstones, small and hard crystallized bits of cholesterol and bile salts, can form in the gallbladder or in the bile duct and block the flow of bile to the intestinal track. This causes the gallbladder to swell and results in excruciating abdominal pain. The recommended method to relieve this severe pain is to undergo gallbladder removal surgery.', 'Anesthesia Malpractice The effects of improper application of anesthesia can be devastating. The range of effects is anywhere from brain damage, to paralysis, to wrongful death. An experienced medical malpractice attorney will be able to marshal the facts of your case in order to command insurance companies to pay you or your family member the compensation you deserve.', 'Failure to Diagnose A misdiagnosis or a delayed diagnosis can be disastrous, especially in conditions involving cancer or heart disease. It can lower the quality of a life and can even lead to death. If you or a family member has been injured as a result of a doctor’s failure to properly diagnose a medical condition, contact a medical malpractice attorney right away.', 'Broken Bones / Orthopedic Injuries A fracture occurs when a force is applied to a bone that is stronger than the bone itself. Risk of fracture depends in part on age. While children are very susceptible to fractures of a less serious nature, the elderly are prone to serious fractures because our bones become more brittle as we age. If the accident that caused your broken bone(s) was caused by the negligence of another person, you may be entitled to compensation.', 'Medication Errors As a patient, your health can suffer drastically as the result of not receiving proper treatment. Proper medical treatment involves not only being appropriately diagnosed, but receiving the appropriate type and amount of medication.

Lamber or G. Goodnow; instead, other lawyers within the firm may be assigned to handle the matter, or with client consent the firm may associate with attorneys at outside law firms to handle the matter.Cases are managed and handled by attorneys in the relevant jurisdiction. Marc Howard Lamber (“Marc Lamber”) is licensed to practice law in Arizona, Colorado Illinois and New York only. Gordon J. Goodnow III is licensed to practice law in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, New York, and the District of Columbia (inactive) only. Matters outside of these jurisdictions are handled by firm attorneys licensed in the relevant jurisdiction or by attorneys at associated law firms licensed in the relevant jurisdiction.Contingent Fee and CostsIn personal injury cases, we operate on\xa0a contingent fee. This means that our fee is a percentage of any recovery we obtain for you, whether by settlement or verdict. Clients are not responsible for paying us fees or costs if we do not recover. This does not include any of the defending party’s fees or costs that a court/arbitrator may assess against a client (e.g., in the event a case is not successful).In the event of recovery, all case-related costs and expenses will be advanced by the firm or firms handling the matter, but the client\xa0agrees that these costs will ultimately be paid from client’s\xa0share of the recovery. Client has no obligation to front these expenses or to pay out-of-pocket for these expenses during the pendency of the case. If there is a financial recovery, however, the client\xa0agrees that the firm or firms will be reimbursed for these expenses out of the recovery; if there is no financial recovery, our firm will write off the expenses and the client\xa0will not be charged for them. Examples of costs and expenses include but are not limited to amounts paid to third parties not employed by our firm, costs of medical records, private investigators, expert witness fees and costs, shipping charges, messenger costs related to the execution of this agreement, electronic research charges, and other expenses borne by the handling law firm(s). If a lawsuit is filed and the defending party prevails, a court may assess the defending parties’ attorneys’ fees and/or taxable costs against the client.Association/Co-Counsel with Outside Firms May Take PlaceWe may associate or co-counsel on certain matters with lawyers not in our firm. \xa0When this occurs, there is generally no additional fee for involving another law firm or lawyer; more specifically, the contingent fee percentage generally remains the same (if not, this would be disclosed the client and require an addendum to the controlling attorney-client agreement). In\xa0this situation, the associating attorney may serve as lead counsel on the matter.\xa0In the event a matter is associated, fees will be shared between Fennemore Craig P.C. and the associated law firm in an amount disclosed to the client in the attorney-client agreement or by another writing. As required by controlling ethics rules,\xa0Fennemore Craig P.C. and the associating law firm will remain jointly responsible for the matter. Even when a matter is associated and the co-counsel firm is serving as lead counsel, clients may always contact Fennemore Craig P.C. to inquire about the status of their matter.This Web Site is Not Legal AdviceThe information contained in this web site has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not legal advice.

Circular 230 was issued by the United States Department of Treasury. It sets forth detailed rules that tax practitioners (including attorneys and accountants) must follow when providing written communications regarding certain Federal tax issues. A “Federal tax issue” is a question concerning the Federal tax treatment of an item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit, the existence or absence of a taxable transfer of property (such as whether a transfer to another is subject to Federal gift tax) or the value of property for Federal tax purposes.When it issued Circular 230, the Department of Treasury articulated its objective to “restore, promote and maintain the public’s confidence in those individuals and firms” that provide tax advice. The failure by a tax practitioner to comply with the requirements of Circular 230 may result in severe penalties, including public censure, monetary fines and/or suspension or disbarment from practicing before the IRS. One nationally prominent tax practitioner and author makes the following observation regarding Circular 230:[The Regulations] are any attempt by the Service to balance concerns about overly aggressive advice provided by some practitioners who were involved in the promotion of abusive tax shelters on the one hand, and the potential imposition of burdensome requirements on the great majority of tax practitioners who never issued such opinions. In that light, the final Regulations can be viewed as a compromise, but one that leans more towards enforcement. Once again, the many will pay for the sins of a few.\xa0Circular 230 applies to not only formal legal opinions but also any writing relating to any Federal tax matter, including e-mail communications. In particular, tax practitioners must now comply with a number of detailed requirements when providing a “Covered Opinion,” including the following:(i) the practitioner must make reasonable efforts to identify and ascertain all relevant facts and may not base the opinion on any “unreasonable factual assumption”;(ii) the practitioner must relate the applicable law – including “any potentially applicable judicial doctrine” – to the relevant facts;(iii) with very limited exceptions, the opinion must consider all “significant” Federal tax issues and reach a conclusion as to the likelihood that the taxpayer will prevail on the merits on each such issue (or if a conclusion cannot be reached, the opinion must so state);(iv) the practitioner must reach an “overall conclusion” as to the likelihood that the stated Federal tax treatment of the arrangement or transaction is the proper treatment and set forth the reasons for that conclusion; and(v) if any one of a number of conditions apply to the opinion, the practitioner must “prominently disclose” those conditions.There are several categories of “Covered Opinions” which are generally not applicable to the tax practice currently maintained by Fennemore Craig. However, the definition of a Covered Opinion is very broad and generally includes any written communication (including e-mail) that (i) addresses a Federal tax issue, (ii) reaches a conclusion favorable to the taxpayer at any confidence level, and (iii) is intended to be relied upon by the taxpayer to avoid penalties.Unfortunately, this firm (and many other firms and individual tax practitioners) anticipate that Circular 230 will increase the cost of delivering to clients written materials discussing tax issues. In most day-to-day correspondence – especially e-mail communications – the costs of complying with the requirements imposed by Circular 230 are likely to be prohibitive relative to the benefit of the written tax advice.Tax practitioners can provide certain types of written communication on tax issues without complying with the extensive requirements of Circular 230 if the written communication includes a statement that the advice given may not be relied upon by the taxpayer to avoid penalties. Consequently, after June 20, 2005, clients of Fennemore Craig will see certain “reliance disclaimers” in various communications from the firm, including e-mail messages. It is anticipated that most written communications from Fennemore Craig attorneys that address Federal tax issues will also include the “reliance disclaimer” unless there is an agreement between the firm and the applicable client as to the need for an opinion that satisfies the requirements of Circular 230.It is our intention to endeavor to continue providing the highest quality legal services to our clients in a cost-effective manner. Please call us if you have any question about how Circular 230 may affect our representation of you in connection with Federal tax matters.Copyright Notice©2016 Fennemore Craig, P.C.
